## School of Data

School of Data LA is a two-day conference and training event happening Thursday and Friday, January 31 and February 1, 2019 at SCAG in Downtown LA. School of Data LA brings together government data analysts, systems analysts, and project managers to address their biggest needs: to improve analytical skills, and to learn from peers across the Southern California region. The School of Data LA programming is driven by community feedback and includes keynotes, workshops, and lightning talks moderated and led by regional government employees who work with data. We believe that building a community of data literacy leads to better service in government.

Our inaugural School of Data LA conference is designed to support civil servants who’d like to improve their data-related work. School of Data LA covers the skills and vocabulary needed to confidently navigate the world of data – everything from documenting metadata, to navigating systems, to managing predictive analytics projects.

## Data + Donuts

Data + Donuts is a monthly morning speaker series in downtown Los Angeles. Data + Donuts presentations feature the data-related work of civil servants across Los Angeles County. The events also facilitate informal connections between government agencies and promote data literacy. All government employees are welcome, and a small portion of seats are made open to the public. Representatives from the Office of LA Controller Ron Galperin, City of Los Angeles, Los Angeles County, and the Southern California Association of Governments plan each Data + Donuts event, with support from Compiler LA.
